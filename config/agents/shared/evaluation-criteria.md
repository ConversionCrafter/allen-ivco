# Evaluation Criteria — What Makes a Good Company

> Shared criteria for all IVCO agents when assessing companies.

## Moat Assessment (Munger's Durable Competitive Advantage)

- **Switching costs**: How painful is it for customers to switch?
- **Network effects**: Does the product get better with more users?
- **Cost advantages**: Structural cost edge (scale, location, process)?
- **Intangible assets**: Patents, brands, regulatory licenses?
- **Efficient scale**: Market too small for a second player?

## Management Quality (Fisher's Scuttlebutt)

- **Say-Do Ratio**: Compare 3-5 years of guidance vs actual results
- **Capital allocation**: How does management deploy retained earnings?
- **Insider ownership**: Do executives own meaningful stock?
- **Succession planning**: Is the business dependent on one person?
- **Integrity gate**: Any accounting irregularities, related-party transactions, or governance red flags → Terminate

## Financial Health (Graham's Margin of Safety)

- **Gross margin > 35%**: Pricing power indicator
- **DSO < industry median**: Cash collection efficiency
- **DIO reasonable**: Inventory management
- **Debt/Equity manageable**: Not over-leveraged

- **OE CAGR > 15%**: Strong compounder threshold
- **CapEx as expansion signal**: 2-3x historical capex = major expansion
