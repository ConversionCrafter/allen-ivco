## Core Formula

```
Three-Layer Calibration Pipeline:
  Layer 1: OE_calibrated = OE × Reality_Coefficient
  Layer 2: CAGR = f(OE_calibrated)
  Layer 3: CAGR_adjusted = CAGR × Confidence_Coefficient

Three-Stage DCF:
  Stage 1 (1-5y): Historical OE × (1 + CAGR×CC)^n, discounted yearly
  Stage 2 (6-10y): Conservative CAGR
  Stage 3 (perpetual): Low growth perpetuity
  Discount rate = US 10Y Treasury + ~3% inflation

IV_per_share = (DCF_Sum - Long_Term_Debt) / Outstanding_Shares
```

## Tech Stack

```
Presentation:  Payload CMS + Next.js
Application:   Python CLI Tools (ivco-*) + n8n Automation
Data:          Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Qdrant (Vector)
Integration:   MCP Servers + Claude Code + Codex
```

## Key Concepts

- **Owner Earnings**: Net Income + D&A - Maintenance CapEx - WC Changes (not Net Income!)
- **Reality Coefficient**: Corrects historical OE distortion (100% = accurate, >100% = understated, <100% = overstated)
- **Confidence Coefficient**: Conservative(0.8-1.0x) / Steady(1.0-1.5x) / Aggressive(1.5-2.5x) / Extreme(2.5x+) / Terminate(N/A)
- **IV must be a RANGE**, never a single number

## Team Roles in IVCO

- **Jane**: Devil's Advocate + engineering orchestrator. Challenges every investment thesis.
- **Chi**: Full-stack engineer persona. Implements features.
- **Fisher**: External brand persona (not an agent). American English, targets English-speaking value investors.

- Atomic commits: one thing per commit
- Python CLI tools prefixed `ivco-*`
- Tests required for feature changes
- Read `CLAUDE.md` in this directory for full detail (Jane's authoritative version)
